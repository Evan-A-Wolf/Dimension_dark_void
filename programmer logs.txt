10/10/2018 Evan Asher Wolfe was accepted into legend gaming studio. It's also on this day that I created this github repository, and I 
started the code for the game. As of right now, the game is a sidescollerish turn based combat game. It is an RPG so stat trees and such
are all going to be super important. My first step is going to be creating a title screen. Just to make it a bit easier to navigate between
the parts of the game I'm going to need to demo. Like the battle system, moving around the overworld etc.

10/11/2018 Start captains log: On this fateful day, the title screen for the commencement of the game was created. Now three empty rooms
can be visited. The player movement test room, the enemy test room, and the battle system test room. These three rooms will be used quite
a bit in the coming days. Even though GML is still my favorite language, and the one that I know the most of my time away from it has
definetely had an impact. I'm beginning to find that my time away from it has taken it's toll. Even doing some simple things like making
a title screen requires a large amount of time and affort. But hey, that's how we learn and get better right?

I also managed to milk some more details out of prince, so now I know a bit more about how the battle system is going to work. He wants it
to be like the old 2d zelda games battle system. I'm gonna try and find out more. I'm also gonna work a bit more on making the player
character along with movement and such but that'll be about all for tonight.
