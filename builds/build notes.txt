Build naming system:
	all builds are named on a numbering system, along with a prefix of pre, alpha, beta, and stable.
	Pre is for all builds before any part of the game is released to the public, patreon, or any other group of 
people outside of the studio.
	alpha is for all builds released to the public or to testers outside of the main group. Ie a beta/alpha tester.
alpha builds will be released exclusivly to help find bugs, and have had very little previous testing.
	Beta builds are all builds released to the public, or to the testers that has had some bug testing, but still
needs more before it's complete.
	Stable builds are builds that have been thouroughly tested for bugs by many members and should have few or no
bugs left. Stable builds are released to the entire public through a mandatory steam update rather than a password
blocked alpha/beta download or through github.

Numbering system:
The build number following the prefix adheres to the following format:
[major release].[minor release].[bug fix].[non-code change]
	the major relase is the number of major changes that have been made. Such as creating the base game, adding 
levels etc.
	The minor release is the number of minor changes that have been made. These are things that have a smaller
effect on the game, things like balancing, changing the player speed, etc. 
	The bug fix is the number of bug fixes to the game.
	the non-code change is any change made to the game that does not affect the code, or does not require the code.
Primarly these are asset updates.

release pre-0.1.0.0
The first build hurray! added a title screen, along with options to take you to the different rooms. Also added player
movement and collisions. The first step is complete!

release pre-0.1.1.0
Found out that part of the collision code didn't save. Re-wrote it so now the collisions will work.
