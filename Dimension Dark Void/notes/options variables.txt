audio:

For the options, several things are needed. Primarly, the ability to turn sound, and music off.
That'll be quite hard to do. I'm thinking that playing music and making sounds will be something along the
lines of a variable. I'm thinking because there are going to be VA's, along with music, and sound effects of
making a variable system. If the player chooses they can change the level of audio. It'll be between 1-10
but on the code side will be divided by 10, so that at 10, the volume will be 1 or full and at 0, the volume 
will be 0 or not there.

This will be available for every type of sound, and there will also be a master sound which will do the math
and scale the other sounds down based on what the master sound is set to in relation to what the other's are
set to.

gameplay:

For the leveling system, I'm going to make it so that the player can choose between 1-10 based on levels, but
based around levels of aptitude. Such as Novice, apprentice, adept, expert, master, legendary(to be changed
later).

it'll also include a bit of a cheat mode, kinda like what celeste has for players. This will allow the player
to manually set the amount of damage taken, the amount of damage delt, the speed of heal and mana regen etc.

Controls:
this will allow the player to manually map their own controls.

Graphics:
the player can switch between full screen, and windowed. They can also change the color/theme of the ui
